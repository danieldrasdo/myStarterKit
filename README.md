# myStarterKit

[myStarterKit](https://github.com/danieldrasdo/myStarterKit) is used in setting up my local developing environment.

1. Open project folder in your IDE
2. Edit your `package.json`'s name and description with pertinent info
3. `Terminal` into your project directory and run `npm install`, then `npm update`\*
4. While still in your project directory run `gulp`
5. Open `index.html` and update the `title`
6. Open sass/js files within `_src`

\* *takes a bit to install dev dependencies. Node.js and Gulp are required to be installed.*

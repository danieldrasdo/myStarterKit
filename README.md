# myStarterKit

[myStarterKit](https://github.com/danieldrasdo/myStarterKit) is used in setting up my local developing environment.

1. Open project folder in your IDE
2. Edit your `package.json`'s name and description with pertinent info
3. `CMD` into your project directory and run `npm install` or `npm update` if install doesn`t work\*
4. Decide if you want css output compressed or not (gulpfile.js sass task)
5. While still in your project directory run `gulp`
6. Open `index.html` and update the `title`
7. Open sass/js files within `_src`
8. Create site favicon using the included `favicon.psd`

\* *takes a bit to install dev dependencies*
